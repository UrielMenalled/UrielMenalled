- Hi, I’m Uriel, a postdoc at Cornell University's Sustinable Cropping Systems Lab and an R enthusiast.  
- I’m interested in agroecology, community ecology, and landscape ecology—can you tell I like ecology? Also, I like to rock: rock climb, rock and roll, and sit on rocking chairs next to warm fires with my cat, Tilo.
